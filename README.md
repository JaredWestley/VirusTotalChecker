#### Credits
This is not my own source, [SamuelTulach](https://github.com/SamuelTulach/VirusTotalUploader) is behind the base code of this project. I have only modified the UI and some of the underlying code, plus I have decided to only release a setup version of the app to streamline it.

#### Warning
This is not officially supported application. It was created because official VirusTotal desktop app is unmaintained. If you are afraid, you can build it from source by yourself. Also please don't download it from any third-party sites.

#### Download (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer"><img alt="GitHub release" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-.NET%20Framework%204.8%20(or later)-blue"></a>)
Please go to [releases page](https://github.com/JaredWestley/VirusTotalChecker/releases) to download compiled app and installer. *Don't forget to star the repo!*

#### How to get API key
It is really simple! All you need to do is to go to [VirusTotal official page](https://www.virustotal.com/), create profile and copy your key.

#### How to use
It is very easy! Drag and drop file into the app and it will upload the file to VirusTotal via their API and open the report for you!
